 Download the "JAR Files" Folder to run the program
 
 This program was created for a hypothetical pizza shop. It is a POS system used to take customer orders as well as manage a 
 list of employees that can access the system. Users may also edit prices for each menu item. Employee's PINs are saved each 
 time the program is closed. Users may add, delete, and modify existing users.
 
 When ordering menu items, Slices will let you modify sizes and toppings. Selected items will appear in the right hand "Cart".
 Items in the cart may be deleted. When finished adding items in the Cart, you may click the "Checkout" button to display all 
 of the items with their relative prices. The checkout screen will also display the tax, subtotal, and total.
